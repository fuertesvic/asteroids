-- ASTEROIDS!!--

The classical [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) game from 1979, implemented in Python using PyGame!
This is a guided project from @Boot.dev. 

The player is a spaceship (represented as a Triangle) , and it must not collide with any of the Asteroids (represented by circles)  

To avoid that, the player can shoot.
